                   Hi I'm Alix, my background is actually in horticulture, I spent the last 10 years managing Sloat Garden Center.
                   Plants have been a hobby of mine for a long time but I needed a new challenge and I would like to turn plants
                   back into a hobby versus my line of work.
                   I figured if I could learn the latin names for most species of plants in California, I could learn 
                   how to code. This class is definitely a challenge for me, I'm going to be honest and say I'm struggling through
                   this first project. I've never even looked at code before the pre-work but I know with time and repetition
                    I will get this. My first vegetable garden was the same way, I didn't give up and now I'm a great gardener, I hope to
                apply that mentality to this endeavor.</a>

                  <p>
                      The coding bootcamp at UC Berkeley is hands on and fast paced. So far we have done a 
                      code refactoring project. I learned what code refactoring is, then applied it to a project wherein we
                       also learned accessibility standards and applied them to the code we were given.
